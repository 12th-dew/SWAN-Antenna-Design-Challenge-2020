# SWAN-Antenna-Design-Challenge-2020

The Design document contains information about the Dual Orthogonal Linear Polarization antenna with a bandwidth of 50MHz to 500MHz for space applications.
The CAD file of our final design is also attached.

This project was done as part of College of Engineering Pune's Astronomy Club under IUCAA's SWAN Antenna Design Challenge 2020

The Sky Watch Array Network (SWAN) aims to create an array of antennas throughout India to serve as a large radio telescope array.
